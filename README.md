# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT - ALX AFRICA
This is a solution for the simple shell project given as part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering Curriculum. 

## Project Objectives
The project came as our final task culminating the completion of C programming in ALX. In this project, we were to 
apply the skills gained throughout the C programming curriculum, including functions, data structures, etc. Our ultimate goal was to creat a solution that mimics a simple 
shell interpreter, where the user can input certain commands to interact with a unix based operating system. 

## Tools/Skills Needed/used
Some of the functions we used for this complex tasks included, but not limited to the following:
+ Basics of programming,
+ Basics of C Programming Language,
+ Basics of thinking like an Engineer,
+ Group work and collaboration,
+ Understanding of learning how to learn,

## Reflection
Overall, this project provided much needed learning and collaborative experience.
