# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT - ALX AFRICA
This is a solution for the simple shell project given as part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering Curriculum. 

## Project Objectives
The project came as our final task culminating the completion of C programming in ALX. In this project, we were to 
apply the skills gained throughout the C programming curriculum, including functions, data structures, etc. Our ultimate goal was to creat a solution that mimics a simple 
shell interpreter, where the user can input certain commands to interact with a unix based operating system. 

## Tools/Skills Needed/used
Some of the functions we used for this complex tasks included, but not limited to the following:
+ Basics of programming,
+ Basics of C Programming Language,
+ Basics of thinking like an Engineer,
+ Group work and collaboration,
+ Understanding of learning how to learn,

## Project Usage
The project can be used as follows:  
**Step 1:** *Forking and Cloning the repository*
+ After forking the repository on github, you need to clone it into your local machine to start testing its functionality. Open the terminal, change directory to where you want to add the project, then clone with these commands
```
cd <options>

git clone <forked project link>
```  
**Step 2:** *Testing the project functionality*
## Reflection
Overall, this project provided much needed learning and collaborative experience.
